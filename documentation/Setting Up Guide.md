# Setting Up Guide

## `espup`

Install `espup` and use it for simplifying the installation and maintainance of the components required to develop Rust applications for the `Xtensa` and `RISC-V` architectures.

### Using `rust-build` installation scripts

This was the **recommended** way in the **past**, but **now** the **installation scripts** are **feature frozen**, and **all new features** will **only** be **included** in **`espup`**. See the repository README for instructions.
